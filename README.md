This mod seeks to add new content to the Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous CRPG from canon Pathfinder material and 3rd party material, but mainly from my original "blend" of ideas. 

This is primarily focused on adding new content, but includes a few fixes and mechanic changes that are related or preparatory for the new content.

A lot of the content of this mod will be overpowered, because I really like power-playing, but the overpowered content can be deactivated (though some new options will depend on it).

Once a game is saved with this mod is enabled it will likely require this mod to be present to load so do not remove or disable the mod once enabled. You can however disable any feature of the mod at will without breaking saves.

All added content and fixes are configurable and can be disabled by editing the various settings json files present in the UserSettings folder of the mod. If this folder is no present start your game with the mod enabled and it will generate.

Please note, however, that I am a very "green" modder, so this mod might be a bit unstable...

**Disclaimer**
This mod was based on a trimmed down and adjusted version of Vek17/Sean Petrie's 1.96b Tabletop Tweaks [https://github.com/Vek17/WrathMods-TabletopTweaks/commit/63d1476cc6d5119bd15a2f3768d89ce164250b36] and
I wanted to credit such an amazing work fully...
